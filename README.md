# 🏢 **Financial Distress Prediction**

### *Bankruptcy Prediction using Machine Learning*

In this notebook, I (👨🏻‍💼) use the dataset [Financial Distress](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shebrahimi/financial-distress?select=Financial+Distress.csv), available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), to evaluate the performance of different Machine Learning models in predicting financial distress. More specifficaly, I will be exploring the following topics on Data Science and Machine Learning:

🧹 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

⚖️ Techniques to deal with **imbalanced data**
- Undersampling
- Oversampling

🤖 Machine Learning (both **Frequentist** and **Bayesian** approaches)
- Logistic Regression
  
For this part, the model selection and hyperparameter tuning will be done using $k$-fold cross-validation and grid search.

📋 Model evaluation and comparison
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Accuracy
  - Recall
  - Precision
  - ROC Curve

It goes without saying that the **topics listed above are not necessairly to be explored in a linear order**. On the contrary: I may need to go back and forth between them, as I see fit. This is pretty common in Data Science projects, as we are always learning new stuff and improving our models.

Along the project, I will be explaining the concepts and techniques used, as well as the results obtained.

Naturaly, I will be using Python and some of its libraries, such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). On the Bayesian side, I will be implementing the models using NumPy and statistical knowledge on Bayesian inference and classification models. 

Please, let me know if you have any suggestions to improve the project!
